# MERN+Auth Starter :rocket:

This is my MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with authentication boilerplate.
The boilerplate comes set up with local auth, but you can add your own methods
easily using Passport. The client and server are coupled, but it's easy enough to
uncouple them.

## Development

Getting started with MERN+Auth Starter is easy. Just run this command in the root
directory to spin up a local instance.

_Note: Make sure you have a MongoDB instance running._

```
yarn install && cd server/client && yarn install && cd ../../ && yarn start
```
